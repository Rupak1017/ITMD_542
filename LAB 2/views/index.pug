              p(class="lead").
                This Lab Assignment Revolves around the concepts of the CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) in a
                Node JS Express application. This involves the creation of a contacts database that features a few fields like
                an autogenerated UUID, first name, last name, email, additional notes, and the date of creation.
              p(class="lead").
                The data is then saved to contacts.json in the database folder.
                The database comes prepopulated with a single entry for John Doe  as an example.
              p(class="lead").
                Feel free to add, edit, view, or delete as you see fit!
              p(class="lead").

              a(href='/contacts', class="btn btn-lg btn-default btn-main") Enter the database!
